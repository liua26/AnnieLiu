<h1>unfortunately, life doesn't always go according to plan...</h1><br>
Rather highlighting ones accomplishments a <br>
failure resume shows the places where one was <br>
shot down but was able to come back and learn from <br>
what happened.<br><br  >
Let's start with the most recent and most important lesson I've learned so far...
<h2>2022</h2>
<div class="container">
  <ul class="myUL">
    <li><b>I graduated high school with IB certificates <br>rather than the diploma</b></li>
      <li> Most important thing I learnt here was <br>that no matter what I should never give <br>up on something that I've spent so much<br> time and effort on. It was the home stretch to get <br>the diploma and I basically gave up at the most <br>crucial moment, which evedently was not ideal.</li><br>
    <li><b>I was rejected from one of my top program choices</b></li>
      <li>I was pressed and unsatisfied with my work<br> for the extra requirements for that program<br> and still submitted my work like that, <br>this defenitely taught me that if you feel<br> like your work isn't up to par, it 100% is not. </li><br>
  </ul>


<h2>2021</h2>
  <ul class="myUL"><li><b>All things academics started going down</b></li>
    <li>If you ask me what I learnt during the 2021 academic <br>school year, I wouldn't be able to remember anything <br>useful, my grades also defenitely tanked during this <br>year as I was not motivated to do anything at school, <br>no one was there to motivate me to study properly and <br>I really did not hold myself accountable.
  </ul>
